        <p>I'm a sophomore at Dartmouth studying Computer Science and Math. I grew up in Palo Alto, CA. My goal is to work on the frontier of systems and applied AI.</p> 
        <p>In addition to my coursework at Dartmouth, I work in the <a href="https://lisplab.host.dartmouth.edu/about/" target="_blank" style="color: #5daeff;">LISP Lab</a> with Professor Peter Chin. Currently, I research model compression for Automatic Speech Recognition systems.</p>
        <p>I'm an avid fan of science-fiction. Some personal favorites include the <i>Three Body Problem</i>, by Cixin Liu, <i>Foundation</i>, by Isaac Asimov, and nearly anything written by Ted Chiang.</p>
